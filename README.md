> Himics, Britz: Trade diversion effects of Preferential Trade Agreements under Tariff Rate Quota Regimes


# Technical notes:

* The .pdf document can be compiled with run_pandoc.bat
* You might need to first set the path to a working miktex environment (set_path.bat)
* The actual content of the presentation is in slide.md (Markdown document). 
* The Markdown doc is later on included in the main .tex file which is sent to pandoc that creates the .pdf presentation
